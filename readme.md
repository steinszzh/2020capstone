# Description



### This is for my capstone at Yeshiva University. 



## Intermediate Work


### Get suitable Data Set for the Project
I used librispeech and TIMIT data set. 

### Try to merge work into Pytorch Dataframe in Colab.



## Final Project

Most process can be read through Colab ipynb directly. 

Read this [Final_Capstone_for_handing_in.ipynb](https://github.com/steinszzh/2020capstone/blob/master/Final_Capstone_for_handing_in.ipynb) 

Some result snap is loaded into Colab as well. 

Due to many load of py file,
Some code will be shown under these two folder.

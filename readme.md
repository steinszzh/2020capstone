# Description



### This is for my capstone at Yeshiva University. 



## Intermediate Work


### Get suitable Data Set for the Project
I used librispeech and TIMIT data set. 

### Try to merge work into Pytorch Dataframe in Colab.



## Final Project

Most process can be read through Colab ipynb directly. 

Some result snap is loaded into Colab as well. 

Due to many load of py file,
Some code will be shown under these two folder.
